# DCS Scratchpad

Resizable and movable DCS World in-game Scratchpad for quick persistent notes - especially useful in VR.

## Installation

Copy the `Scripts` folder into your DCS Saved games folder.

## Usage

- Toggle the scratchpad with `CTRL+Shift+X`
- Use `Esc` to remove the text field focus, but keep the scratchpad open

## Settings

Some settings can be changed in your DCS saved games folder under `Config/ScratchpadConfig.lua` (if the file does not exist, start DCS once after mod installation):

- `hotkey` hotkey to toggle the Scratchpad (`CTRL+Shift+X` by default) ¹
- `hotkeyNextPage` hotkey to switch to the next page (not set by default) ¹
- `hotkeyPrevPage` hotkey to switch to the next page (not set by default) ¹
- `hotkeyInsertCoordinates` hotkey to add coordinates from the F10 map (not set by default) ¹
- `fontSize` increase or decrease the font size of the Scratchpads textarea (`14` by default)
- `clearOnLoad` removes all pages on load (`false` by default)

_¹ check `DCS World\dxgui\bind\KeyNames.txt` to find how to reference a key; only the keys can be used, that work without having to press `Shift` - so `(` cannot be used, but `Shift+9` can_

## Scratchpad Content

The Scratchpads content is persisted into `Scratchpad\0000.txt` (in your saved games folder; if the file does not exist, start DCS once after mod installation/upgrade). You can also change the file in your favorite text editor before starting DCS.

### Multiple Pages

When DCS starts, the Scratchpad looks for all text files inside the `Scratchpad\` directory (in your DCS saved games folder that do not exceed a file size of 1MB). If there is more than one, it will show buttons (←/→) that can be used to switch between all those text files. The file `Scratchpad\0000.txt`, where the content is persisted into by default, can be freely renamed, it is _not_ necessary to use the `000x` naming scheme.

## Insert Coordinates from F10 map

This is only available in single player or for servers that have _Allow Player Export_ enabled. If available, you'll have a checkbox at the bottom for the Scratchpad. The mode to insert coordinates is active while the checkbox is checked. While active, you'll have a white dot in the center of your screen and an additional `+ L/L` button below the text area of the Scratchpad. Open the F10 map and align the white dot with your location of interest and hit the `+ L/L` button. This will add the coordinates of the location below the white cursor to your Scratchpad.

### Insert waypoints into the NS430

Hitting the `+L/L` button in spectator or an aircraft that can use the NS430 inserts a line that looks like `FIX;-88.245167;36.117167;%PlaceholderName`. The `%PlaceholderName` must be changed to a 1-5 character long alpha-numeric string (e.g. `1A`, `1B`, `2`, `3`, `WILLO`). This can then be added into the `navaids.dat` in the main DCS folder `.\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\NS430\Cockpit\Scripts\avionics\terrain\navaids.dat` (you need to respawn for the `navaids.dat` changes to take effect) and then be loaded into the NS430 via the Flight Plan Page or Direct-To page.
